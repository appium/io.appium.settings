# Build Note

## Network Connectivity Issue

During the verification process, a network connectivity issue was encountered when trying to build the project:

```
Could not GET 'https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/com/android/tools/build/gradle/8.13.0/gradle-8.13.0.pom'
dl.google.com: No address associated with hostname
```

This is a known environment limitation in the sandboxed build environment and is **not related to the SDK version changes** made in this PR. The Android Gradle Plugin version 8.13.0 was already present in the repository before these changes.

## Verification Status

✅ **Code Changes**: All changes successfully made and committed
✅ **Security Check**: CodeQL analysis completed with no issues detected
⚠️ **Build Test**: Could not be completed due to network connectivity restrictions

## Changes Summary

1. **SDK Versions Updated**:
   - minSdkVersion: 21 → 26
   - targetSdkVersion: 32 → 35
   - compileSdk: 32 → 35

2. **Manifest Updates**:
   - Added FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION permission
   - Added FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION permission
   - Added foregroundServiceType="location" to LocationService
   - Added foregroundServiceType="location" to ForegroundService

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive SDK_VERSION_CHANGELOG.md detailing all Android API changes from 32 to 35

## Next Steps

The CI/CD pipeline in the GitHub repository should have proper network access to build the project. The changes in this PR are configuration-only and follow Android best practices for API 34+ compatibility.

## Testing Recommendations

Once the build succeeds in CI:
1. Test on Android 8.0 (API 26) devices to ensure minimum SDK compatibility
2. Test on Android 14 (API 34) devices to verify foreground service types work correctly
3. Test on Android 15 (API 35) devices to ensure full target SDK compliance
4. Verify all app features (location mocking, notification handling, screen recording) function correctly
