# Settings

Toggle settings in Android device or emulator.

A small and simple Android application that deals with the system settings. Then the application shuts down.


## Requirements

* [Android SDK](developer.android.com)
* [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

You may also consider using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) to debug the code easily.

## Building

```shell
$ ./gradlew clean assembleDebug
```

You can also run `gradlew installDebug` to build and immediately deploy the app to a connected Android device or emulator.


## Installing

You can install the apk through the [Android Debug Bridge](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html).

To install:

```shell
$ cd app/build/outputs/apk
$ adb install settings_apk-debug.apk
```

To uninstall:

```shell
$ adb uninstall io.appium.settings
```


## Changing of system settings

Once installed on a device, you can change the `wifi`, `data`, `animation` and `locale` settings through the following commands:

To turn on `wifi`:

```shell
$ adb shell am broadcast -a io.appium.settings.wifi --es setstatus enable
```

To turn off `wifi`:

```shell
$ adb shell am broadcast -a io.appium.settings.wifi --es setstatus disable
```

To turn on `data`:

```shell
$ adb shell am broadcast -a io.appium.settings.data_connection --es setstatus enable
```

To turn off `data`:

```shell
$ adb shell am broadcast -a io.appium.settings.data_connection --es setstatus disable
```

To turn on `animation`:

```shell
$ adb shell am broadcast -a io.appium.settings.animation --es setstatus enable
```

To turn off `animation`:

```shell
$ adb shell am broadcast -a io.appium.settings.animation --es setstatus disable
```

Set particular locale:

```shell
$ adb shell am broadcast -a io.appium.settings.locale --es lang ja --es country JP
```

You can set the [Locale](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.html) format, especially this feature support [Locale(String language, String country)](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.html#Locale(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)) so far.


## Retrieval of system settings

You can retrieve the current geo location by executing:

```shell
$ adb shell am broadcast -a io.appium.settings.location -n io.appium.settings/.receivers.LocationInfoReceiver
```

The first value in the returned `data` string is the current latitude, the second is the longitude and the last one is the altitude. An empty string is returned if the data cannot be retrieved (more details on the failure cause can be found in the logcat output).


## Notes:

* You have to specify the receiver class if app never executed before:
```shell
$ adb shell am broadcast -a io.appium.settings.wifi -n io.appium.settings/.receivers.WiFiConnectionSettingReceiver --es setstatus disable
```
* To change animation setting, app should be granted `SET_ANIMATION_SCALE` permission:
```shell
$ adb shell pm grant io.appium.settings android.permission.SET_ANIMATION_SCALE
```
* To change locale setting, app should be granted `CHANGE_CONFIGURATION` permission:
```shell
$ adb shell pm grant io.appium.settings android.permission.CHANGE_CONFIGURATION
```

* On Android 6.0+ you must enable the corresponding permissions for the app first. This can be
done in application settings, Permissions entry.

* Switching mobile data on/off requires the phone to be rooted on Android 5.0+
('su' binary is expected to be available on internal phone file system).

Voila!


## Caveats

There are certain system services which cannot be accessed through an application. Two ones central here are `airplane_mode` and `gps`.
